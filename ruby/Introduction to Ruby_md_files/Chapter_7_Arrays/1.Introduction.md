## Arrays
1. *Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.*
2. *each - is sufficient for many usages*
3. *each_ with _index acts like Hash#each - you get the value and the index.*
4. *map - is another way to iterate, useful when you want to transform one array into another.*
5. *select - is the iterator to use when you want to choose a subset.*
6. *inject - is useful for generating sums or products.*
```
	array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	array.each { |x| puts x }
```
#### Output
```
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
