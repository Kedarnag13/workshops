## Arrays
1. *Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.*
2. *each - is sufficient for many usages*
3. *each_ with _index acts like Hash#each - you get the value and the index.*
4. *map - is another way to iterate, useful when you want to transform one array into another.*
5. *select - is the iterator to use when you want to choose a subset.*
6. *inject - is useful for generating sums or products.*
```
	array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	array.each { |x| puts x }
```
#### Output
```
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	6
```
7. *To get both the value and index*
```
	array = ["A", "B", "C"]
	array.each_with_index {|val, index| puts "#{val} => #{index}" }
```
#### Output
```
	A => 0
	B => 1
	C => 2
```
8. **Operations on Arrays**
```
	* [1, 2, 3] * 3 => [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
	* [1, 2, 3].join(",") => "1,2,3"
	* [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	* [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5] - [1, 2, 4] => [3, 3, 5]
	* [1, 2] << "c" << "d" << [3, 4] => [1, 2, "c", "d", [3, 4]]
