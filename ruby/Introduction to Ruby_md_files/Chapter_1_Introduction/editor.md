## Editors
1. **VIM**
	* *It is not a good habbit to write programs using a text editor.*
	* *In my opinion, we should start with any kind of IDE, it doesn't matter at all.*
	* *Once we decide to become a full stack ruby developer, I recommend we should learn VIM.*
2. **Text Mate 2**
3. **Sublime Text**
4. **RubyMine**
