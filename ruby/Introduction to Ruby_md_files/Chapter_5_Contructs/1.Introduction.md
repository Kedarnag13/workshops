## If else construct
1. *In Ruby, if is an expression, not a statement. In fact, everything is an expression, there are no statements.*
2. *if condition
  		foo(something)
	else
  		foo(something_else)
	end*

## Inline If
1. *statement if condition*

## If else then construct
1. *then is a delimiter to help ruby identify the condition and the true-part expr.*
2. *if condition then true-part else false-part end*
3. *then is optional unless you want to write an if expression in one line.*
4. *puts if (val == 1) then '1' else 'Not 1' end*
5. *puts if (val == 1)
  		'1'
	else
  		'Not 1'
	end*

## Unless construct
1. *is the opposite of if*
2. *it executes code only if an associated expression evaluates to false or nil.*
3. *unless construct begins with unless and ends with end.*

## Ternary 
1. *concise alternative to simple if/else statements we can use the conditional or ternary ?: operator*
2. *    (condition) ? (result if condition is true) : (result if condition is false)  *

## Case Expression
1. *This form is fairly close to a series of if statements.*
2. *lets you list a series of conditions and execute a statement corresponding to the first one that's true.*
