## Blocks
1. *Ruby blocks are syntax literals for Proc objects.*
2. *They are defined as instructions between curly braces {} or do...end for multiline block.*
3. *do...end have lower precedence than the curely braces.*
4. *Blocks can optionally take arguments and return values*
```
	add = Proc.new{ |x|  x+1 }
	add.call(1)
```
#### Output
```
	2
```
5. yield is mainly used to invoke a block statement.
