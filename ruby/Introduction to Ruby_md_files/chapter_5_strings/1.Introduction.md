## Strings
1. *A String object holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically representing characters. String objects may be created using String::new or as literals.*
2. *There are many methods in the String class (you don't have to memorize them all;)*
3. *Like the reverse that gives a backwards version of a string*
4. *Length that tells us the number of characters (including spaces) in the string.*
5. *upcase changes every lowercase letter to uppercase, and downcase changes every uppercase letter to lowercase.*
6. *swapcase switches the case of every letter in the string, and finally, capitalize is just like downcase, except that it switches the first character to uppercase (if it is a letter)*
7. *slice gives you a substring of a larger string.*
