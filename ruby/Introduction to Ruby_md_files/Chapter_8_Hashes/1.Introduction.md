## Hashes
1. *A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values.*
2. *Hashers are a powerful collections.*
3. *A hash is useful to store what are called "key/value pairs."*
4. *A key/value pair has an identifier to signify which variable of the hash you want to access and a variable to store in that position in the hash.*
5. *A hash variable can be created the same way as an array variable.*
6. *The simplest method is to create an empty hash object and fill it with key/value pairs.*
7. *Hashes are "unordered," meaning there is no defined beginning or end as there is in an array.*
8. *Appending to a hash is not possible.*
9. *Values are simply "inserted" or created in the hash using the index operator.*
```
	wheels = Hash.new
	wheels["car"] = 4
	wheels["bus"] = 6
	wheels["bike"] = 2
	wheels["truck"] = 8
```
10. *hashes can be created with hash literals.*
11. *Hash literals use the curly braces instead of square brackets and the key value pairs are joined by =>.*
```
	wheels = {
	wheels["car"] => 4,
	wheels["bus"] => 6,
	wheels["bike"] => 2,
	wheels["truck"] => 8,
	}
```
12. *Accessing variables in Hash*
```
	wheels = {
	"car" => 4,
	"bus" => 6,
	"bike" => 2,
	"truck" => 8,
	}
	wheels.each do |key, value|
		puts "#{key}: #{value}"
	end
```
#### Output
```
	car: 4
	bus: 6
	bike: 2
	truck: 8
```
