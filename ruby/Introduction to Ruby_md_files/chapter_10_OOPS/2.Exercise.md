### Exercise 1
*The following is our base class*
```
	class Vehicle
  		def initialize(drive_type)
    			@drive_type = drive_type
  		end
 
  		def on_road
    			puts 'Always follow lane'
  		end
 
  		def off_road
    			puts 'Rough Terrain'
  		end
	end
```
```
	class Car < Vehicle
  		def on_road
    			puts "I like to go #{@drive_type}"
  		end
	end
 
	class DirtBike < Vehicle
  		def on_road
    			puts "Not soo good"
  		end
 
  		def off_road
    			puts 'I like to go #{@drive_type}'
  		end
	end
```
```
	vehicles = [Vehicle.new('Rough Terrain'), Car.new('Flat Road'), DirtBike.new('Rough Terrain')]
	vehicles.each do |veh|
		veh.on_road
	end
```
#### Output
```

```
```
	vehicles.each do |veh|
		veh.off_road
	end
```
#### Output
```

```
## In Ruby
### Exercise 2
```
	class Car
		def on_road
    			puts "I like to go #{@drive_type}"
  		end
 
  		def off_road
    			puts 'Not soo good'
  		end
  	end

  	class DirtBike
  		def on_road
    			puts "Not soo good"
  		end
 
  		def off_road
    			puts 'I like to go #{@drive_type}'
  		end
  	end
```
1. *Each type of vehicle has its own methods now.*
2. *Shared methods go into modules.*
3. *Now we can include them in our classes *
```
	module Vehicle
		def initialize(drive_type)
    			@drive_type = drive_type
  		end
  	end
```
```
	class Car
		include Vehicle
		...
	end
	class DirtBike
		include Vehicle
		...
	end
```
